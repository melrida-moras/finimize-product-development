## Project overview
Finimize simplifies financial information for modern retail investors by providing accessible insights, news, and education. This project evaluates Finimize’s positioning and proposes a **product development direction** supported by data collection and analysis.

### Key objectives
- Understand *why Finimize* and its value proposition
- Review performance/market positioning (high-level)
- Use strategic frameworks to propose growth direction
- Define the data needed for analytics and prediction to support product decisions

## Approach
This project uses a structured business + analytics lens:

### 1) Strategic analysis
- **Investment highlights / business performance indicators** (high-level)
- **SWOT analysis** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
- **Ansoff Matrix** focus: **Product Development** (new product features for existing users/markets)

### 2) Proposed product direction (example concept)
A new feature direction includes a **user dashboard** for clearer personal finance visibility, such as:
- **Monthly Spend Analyzer**
- **Monthly income / savings snapshot**
- Summary-style views that support better financial behaviour and engagement

### 3) Data & analytics plan
A proposed analytics workflow covers:
- Market trends analysis
- Competitor analysis
- Customer preference and behaviour analysis
- Risk analysis and global economic context

## Data sources considered (examples)
- **Social media data** (sentiment, engagement signals)
- **Web & clickstream data** (user journeys, drop-offs, content consumption)
- **Mobile app data** (feature usage, retention signals)

## Example predictions / insights to generate
- **Customer support ticket themes** → identify pain points and prioritise fixes
- Engagement and retention signals → what content/features drive returning users
- Behaviour patterns → how spend/income/savings interactions relate to user outcomes
- Satisfaction drivers → what correlates with higher user satisfaction and subscription value
