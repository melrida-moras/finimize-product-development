# Finimize — Data Strategy & Dashboard Prototypes (Case Study)

A business + data analytics case study on **Finimize** focused on understanding the product, analysing growth opportunities, and proposing a **data-driven dashboard experience** to improve financial guidance and increase subscriptions.

## Project Summary

Finimize simplifies financial news and education for everyday investors. In this project, I:
- reviewed Finimize’s positioning, growth signals, and business model,
- conducted structured strategic analysis (e.g., SWOT, growth strategy framing),
- proposed a **Product Development** direction (Ansoff),
- designed **two dashboard prototypes**:
  1) a **User Financial Health Dashboard** and  
  2) a **Customer Satisfaction Summary Dashboard**

The aim was to show how Finimize could use data to:
- help users understand spending habits and financial health,
- guide investment decisions based on risk/efficiency,
- improve retention and conversion to paid subscriptions.

## What I Built / Delivered

### 1) Strategy + Business Analysis
- **Vision & Mission framing**
- **Key business metrics** and performance indicators (revenue, cash flow, growth, engagement)
- **SWOT analysis** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
- **Growth strategy direction** using Ansoff (focus: **Product Development**)

### 2) Data Requirements & Analytics Plan
Defined what data is needed to support product decisions, including:
- market and user engagement trends
- financial efficiency & debt indicators
- customer preferences and competitor landscape
- regulatory and macroeconomic considerations

### 3) Dashboard Prototypes (Designed by Me)

#### A) User Financial Health Dashboard
A personalised view of a user’s finances to drive better decisions:
- monthly income, savings, and expense breakdown
- spending analysis and budget insights
- financial efficiency scoring
- debt-to-income indicator
- investment allocation view (e.g., sectors/categories)

**Goal:** guide financially non-efficient users toward better habits and encourage subscription uptake.

#### B) Customer Satisfaction Summary Dashboard
A product + growth view combining experience and engagement signals:
- web/app engagement KPIs (traffic, session duration, bounce rate, conversions)
- satisfaction distribution
- user segmentation (age, gender, preferences)
- subscription trend signals

**Goal:** give a high-level view of customer health and identify drivers of churn vs retention.

## Key Questions the Product Should Ask Users
To enable a personalised dashboard and meaningful recommendations:
- **Income:** total monthly income, multiple income sources, % intended for investment
- **Expenses:** regular spend categories (rent, groceries, transport), allocation of excess income
- **Savings:** savings balance + other saving instruments
- **Risk tolerance:** willingness to take investment risk

---

## Data Sources Considered (High Level)
Examples of data that would support the dashboards:
- user-entered finance details and/or transaction summaries
- engagement analytics (web/app usage events)
- customer feedback and satisfaction surveys
- customer support tickets and resolution stats
- market/competitor benchmarks
- macroeconomic and regulatory signals
